# Search overview

What is a search query?

To get information from your indexed data, you create a *search query*, or *query* that defines the question you want answered about your data.  .. . .using REST APIs.

Think of a typical keyword search to a search engine to return results that have been indexed. 

Use a *query* to search your data streams or indices for information that you define by fields. 

Queries define questions you want answered about your data.

## Custom search options

What users expect from search engines has evolved over the years. Just returning relevant results quickly is no longer enough for most users. Now users seek methods that allow them to get even more relevant results, to sort and organize results, and to highlight their queries. OpenSearch includes many features, described in the following table, that enhance the search experience.

Feature | Description
:--- | :---
[Autocomplete functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/autocomplete) | Suggest phrases as the user types.
[Did-you-mean functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/autocomplete) | Check spelling of phrases as the user types.
[Paginate results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/paginate) | Rather than a single, long list, separate search results into pages.
[Sort results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/sort) | Allow sorting of results by different criteria.
[Highlight query matches]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/highlight) | Highlight the search term in the results.

## Advanced search types

You can perform optional search types such as:

* Use Query DSL query types
* Paginate search results — (link to page)
* Run async search
* Sort search results
* Retrieve selected fields
* Search multiple data streams and indices
