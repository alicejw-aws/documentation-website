# Search for k-NN with filters
Introduced 2.4
{: .label .label-purple }

You can create custom filters using Query DSL search options to refine your k-NN searches. You define the filter criteria within the `knn_vector` field's `filter` subsection in your query. The most commonly used Query DSL query types are: term, range, regex and wildcard. To include or exclude results, you specify Boolean query clauses. You also specify a query point with the `knn_vector` type and search for nearest neighbors that match your filter criteria.
To run k-NN queries with a filter, the Lucene search engine and HSNW method are required.

To learn more about how to use Query DSL Boolean query clauses, see [Boolean queries]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/bool).
{: .note }

## How does a k-NN filter work?

The OpenSearch k-NN plugin version 2.2 provided support for the Lucene engine to process k-NN searches. The Lucene engine provides a search that is based on the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HSNW) algorithm to represent a multi-layered graph. The OpenSearch k-NN plugin version 2.4 is able to incorporate filters for searches based on Lucene 9.4.

After a filter is applied to a set of documents to be searched, the algorithm decides whether to perform pre-filtering for an exact kNN search or modified post-filtering for approximate search. The approximate search with filtering guarantees the top number of closest vectors in result.

Lucene also provides the capability to operate its `KnnVectorQuery` over a subset of documents. To learn more about Luceneâ€™s new capability, see the [Apache Lucene Documentation](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-10382).

### Filtered search performance

Filtering that is tightly integrated with the Lucene HNSW algorithm implementation allows you to to apply k-NN searches more efficiently both in terms of relevancy of search results and performance. Consider that if you do an exact search on a large data set, the results are slow, and post-filtering does not guarantee the required number of results you specify for the `k` value.
With this new capability, you can create an approximate k-NN search and apply filters, with the amount of results you need.

The following workflow diagram shows how the HSNW algorithm decides which type of filtering to apply to a search based on the volume of documents, and number of `k` points in the index that you search with a filter. The variables shown in the diagram are described in the table below.

Variable | Description |
-- | -- | -- |
N | Number of documents in the index.
P | Number of documents in the search set after the filter is applied using the formula: P <= N.
q | The search vector.
k | The maximum number of vectors to return in the response.

## Filter approaches by use case

Depending on the data set that you are searching, you might choose a different approach to minimize recall or latency. You can create filters that are either: very selective (80%), somewhat selective (38%), or not very selective (2.5%). The selectiveness percentage indicates the amount the filter returns for any given document set in an index.

#### Filter selectiveness with latency per doc set volume

Number of vectors | Selectiveness of filter, % | k | Recall | Latency
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
10M | 2.5 | 100 | score_script | score_script
10M | 38 | 100 | lucene_filtering | Boolean filter
10M | 80 | 100 | score_script | lucene_filtering
1M | 2.5 | 100 | lucene_filtering | score_script
1M | 38 | 100 | lucene_filtering | lucene_filtering / score_script
1M | 80 | 100 | Boolean filter | lucene_filtering

In this context, `score_script` is essentially a brute force search, whereas a Boolean filter is an approximate k-NN search with post-filtering.

To learn more about the dynamic searches you can perform with the score script plugin, see [Exact k-NN with scoring script]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/knn/knn-score-script/).

### Boolean filter with approximate k-NN search

In a Boolean query that uses post-filtering, you can join a k-NN query with a filter using a `bool` `must` query clause.

#### Sample request

The following k-NN query uses a Boolean query clause to filter results:

```json
POST /hotels-index/_search
{
    "size": 3,
    "query": {
        "bool": {
            "filter": {
                "bool": {
                    "must": [
                        {
                            "range": {
                                "rating": {
                                    "gte": 8,
                                    "lte": 10
                                }
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "term": {
                                "parking": "true"
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "must": [
                {
                    "knn": {
                        "location": {
                            "vector": [
                                5.0,
                                4.0
                            ],
                            "k": 20
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
#### Sample response

The Boolean query filter returns the following results in the response:

```json
{
  "took" : 95,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 5,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.72992706,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "hotels-index",
        "_id" : "3",
        "_score" : 0.72992706,
        "_source" : {
          "location" : [
            4.9,
            3.4
          ],
          "parking" : "true",
          "rating" : 9
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "hotels-index",
        "_id" : "6",
        "_score" : 0.3012048,
        "_source" : {
          "location" : [
            6.4,
            3.4
          ],
          "parking" : "true",
          "rating" : 9
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "hotels-index",
        "_id" : "5",
        "_score" : 0.24154587,
        "_source" : {
          "location" : [
            3.3,
            4.5
          ],
          "parking" : "true",
          "rating" : 8
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```



### Use case 1: Very selective 2.5% filter

A very selective filter returns the least amount of documents in your data set. For example, the following filter criteria specifies hotels with feedback ratings less than or equal to 3. This 2.5% filter only returns 1 document:

```json
                "filter": {
                    "bool": {
                        "must": [
                            {
                                "range": {
                                    "rating": {
                                        "lte": 3
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
```

### Use case 2: Somewhat selective 38% filter

A somewhat selective filter returns 38% of the documents in the doc set that you search. For example, the following filter criteria specifies hotels with parking and feedback ratings less than or equal to 8, and returns 5 documents.

```json
               "filter": {
                    "bool": {
                        "must": [
                            {
                                "range": {
                                    "rating": {
                                        "lte": 8
                                    }
                                }
                            },
                            {
                                "term": {
                                    "parking": "true"
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
```

### Use case 3: Not very selective 80% filter

A filter that is not very selective will return 80% of the documents that you search. For example, the following filter criteria specifies hotels with feedback ratings greater than or equal to 5, and returns 10 documents.

```json
                "filter": {
                    "bool": {
                        "must": [
                            {
                                "range": {
                                    "rating": {
                                        "gte": 5
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
```

## Overview: How to use filters in a k-NN search

The workflow to search with a filter includes three steps:
1. Create an index and specify the requirements for Lucene engine and HSNW in the mapping.
1. Add your data to the index.
1. Search the index and specify these three items in your query:
* One or more filters defined by Query DSL
* A vector reference point defined by the `vector` field.
* The number of matches you want returned with the `k` field.

We use a range query to specify hotel feedback ratings, and a term query to require that parking is available. The criteria is processed with Boolean clauses to indicate whether or not the document contains the criteria.

Consider a data set that contains 12 documents, a search reference point, and documents that meet two filter criteria.

![Graph of documents with filter criteria]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/knn-two-filters.png)

***Figure 2: Graph of documents that meet filter criteria***

## Step 1: Create a new index with a lucene mapping

Before you can do a k-NN search with a filter, you need to create an index, specify the lucene engine in a mapping, and add data to the index.

You need to add a `location` field to represent the location, and specify it as the `knn_vector` type. The most basic vector can be two dimensions. For example:

```
  "type": "knn_vector",
  "dimension": 2,
```

### Requirement: Lucene engine with HNSW method

Make sure to specify "hnsw" method and "lucene" engine in the `knn_vector` field description, as follows:

```json
"my_field": {
                "type": "knn_vector",
                "dimension": 2,
                "method": {
                    "name": "hnsw",
                    "space_type": "l2",
                    "engine": "lucene"
                }
            }
```

#### Sample request

The following request creates a new index called "hotels-index."

```json
PUT /hotels-index
{
    "settings": {
        "index": {
            "knn": true,
            "knn.algo_param.ef_search": 100,
            "number_of_shards": 1,
            "number_of_replicas": 0
        }
    },
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "knn_vector",
                "dimension": 2,
                "method": {
                    "name": "hnsw",
                    "space_type": "l2",
                    "engine": "lucene",
                    "parameters": {
                        "ef_construction": 100,
                        "m": 16
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
#### Sample response

Upon success, you should receive "200-OK" status with the following response:

```json
{
  "acknowledged" : true,
  "shards_acknowledged" : true,
  "index" : "hotels-index"
}
```

## Step 2: Add data to your index

Next, add data to your index with a PUT HTTP request. Make sure that the search criteria is defined in the body of the request.

#### Sample request

The following request adds twelve hotel documents that contain criteria such as feedback ratings and whether or not parking is available.  

```json
POST /_bulk
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "1" } }
{ "location": [5.2, 4.4], "parking" : "true", "rating" : 5 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "2" } }
{ "location": [5.2, 3.9], "parking" : "false", "rating" : 4 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "3" } }
{ "location": [4.9, 3.4], "parking" : "true", "rating" : 9 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "4" } }
{ "location": [4.2, 4.6], "parking" : "false", "rating" : 6}
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "5" } }
{ "location": [3.3, 4.5], "parking" : "true", "rating" : 8 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "6" } }
{ "location": [6.4, 3.4], "parking" : "true", "rating" : 9 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "7" } }
{ "location": [4.2, 6.2], "parking" : "true", "rating" : 5 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "8" } }
{ "location": [2.4, 4.0], "parking" : "true", "rating" : 8 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "9" } }
{ "location": [1.4, 3.2], "parking" : "false", "rating" : 5 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "10" } }
{ "location": [7.0, 9.9], "parking" : "true", "rating" : 9 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "11" } }
{ "location": [3.0, 2.3], "parking" : "false", "rating" : 6 }
{ "index": { "_index": "hotels-index", "_id": "12" } }
{ "location": [5.0, 1.0], "parking" : "true", "rating" : 3 }
```

#### Sample response

Upon success, you should receive "200-OK" status with entries for each of the document IDs that you added to the index. The following response is truncated to only show one document:

```json
{
  "took" : 140,
  "errors" : false,
  "items" : [
    {
      "index" : {
        "_index" : "hotels-index",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_version" : 2,
        "result" : "updated",
        "_shards" : {
          "total" : 1,
          "successful" : 1,
          "failed" : 0
        },
        "_seq_no" : 12,
        "_primary_term" : 3,
        "status" : 200
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Step 3: Search your data with a filter

Now you can create a k-NN search that specifies filters using Query DSL Boolean clauses. You need to include your reference point to search for nearest neighbors. Provide an x-y coordinate for the point with the `vector` field, such as `"vector": [ 5.0, 4.0]`

 To learn more about how to specify ranges with Query DSL, see [Range query]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/term/#range-query).
{: .note }

#### Sample request

The following request creates a k-NN query that only returns the top hotels rated between 8 and 10, and that provide parking. The filter criteria is indicated with the Query DSL `range` query clause to indicate the range for the feedback ratings, and a `term` query clause to indicate "parking."

```json
POST /hotels-index/_search
{
    "size": 3,
    "query": {
        "knn": {
            "location": {
                "vector": [
                    5.0,
                    4.0
                ],
                "k": 3,
                "filter": {
                    "bool": {
                        "must": [
                            {
                                "range": {
                                    "rating": {
                                        "gte": 8,
                                        "lte": 10
                                    }
                                }
                            },
                            {
                                "term": {
                                    "parking": "true"
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


#### Sample Response

The following response indicates that only three hotels met the filter criteria:


```json
{
  "took" : 47,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 3,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.72992706,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "hotels-index",
        "_id" : "3",
        "_score" : 0.72992706,
        "_source" : {
          "location" : [
            4.9,
            3.4
          ],
          "parking" : "true",

## Additional complex filter query

Depending on how selective you want your filter to operate, you can add multiple query types to a single request, such as: `term`, `wildcard`,  `regexp`, and `range`. You can then filter out the search results with the Boolean clauses `must`, `should`, and `must_not`.

#### Sample request

The following request filters returns hotels that provide parking. This request illustrates alternate mechanisms to obtain the "parking:"true" criteria. It uses a regular expression for the value `true`, a term query for the key-value pair "parking":"true", a wildcard for the characters that spell "true", and the `must_not` clause set to "parking" `false`.
